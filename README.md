# üí´ About Me:
I like to build interactive apps using Node.js and PHP.<br>My latest project allows users to track and analyze their listening habits. By logging in with their Spotify account, it captures key data such as song name, artist, album, genre, and playtime. The app provides insights through features like recent songs, artist playtime, and streak tracking, offering a personalized and data-driven music experience.<br><br>I have also built a Node.js app that works with a Minecraft plugin and displays server info on a page, including the number of players online, their locations, and other server details such as in-game time and weather.
